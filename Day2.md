in powershell, parenthesis means "do this first"
```powershell
get-item c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe | select-object -property name 
#gets the name 
#or, with parenthesis
(get-item C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe).name

hash table: powershell's version of a dictionary

```powershell
$hashtable = @{}
#declaring a hash table
#powershell automatically sorts hashtables or somem shit
$hashtable = [ordered]@{}
#this makes it so that it doesnt automatically sort, keeps the values in the order you put them in
$orderedhashtable = [ordered]@{}
$notorderedhastable = @{ Game = "Minecraft ; Publisher = "Mojang" }
#calling on $notorderedhashtable will result in a name column and a value column, with game and publisher being name and
$notorderedhashtable["Game"]
#output would display Minecraft
$notorderedhashtable.name or $notorderedhashtable.values
#will print name or value 
$notorderedhashtable.cost = "'$26.95"
#will add a value in the hash table for cost that = 26.95
$notorderedhashtable["Cost"]=""'$1,000"
#this changes this value of cost to 1,000 
#or
$notorderedhashtable.cost="'$1,000"
#which is a lot easier
```

## Activities
### ACTIVITY: Reverse Arrays
- Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point. 
    - The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0. The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.
```powershell
$start = Get-Random -Minimum -10 Maximum 1
$stop = Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 20
$array = $start..$stop
$array
#or
$array = (Get-Random -Minimum -10 -Maximum 1)..(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 20)
```
- Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
```powershell 
$reversed = $array[($array.length-1)..0]
$reversed
```

### ACTIVITY: Arrays & Hash Tables
Create two empty hash tables with the following names:
  1. employee1
  2. employee2
```powershell
$employee1 = [ordered]@{}
$employee1.First = "Mary"
$employee1["Last"] = "Hopper
$employee1.ID = "001"
$employee1["Job"] = "Software Developer"

$employee2 = @{Same shit as first employee}
```
 - Now add a new key called Username which holds a contraction of the employeeâ€™s first initial then last name then ID. (i.e. mhopper001)
 ```powershell
 [
 ```
  - Mary got promoted to "Software Lead" so the job key for Mary needs to be changed to "Software Lead"
 ```powershell
 $employee1.Job = "Software Lead"
 ```
  - Create a new hash table called "employee3" that contains the following values with the respective keys.
 ```powershell
 $employee3 = [ordered]@{same shit}
 ```
  - Add a new key called "Status" that holds the values:
```powershell
$employee1.Status = "Management"
same shit
same shit 
```

#### Pipeline
```powershell
function fruit-output {
  Write-Output "Apple"
  Write-Output "Orange"
  Write-Output "Banana"
  Write-Output "Pear"
  }
  #doing fruit-output will return apple orange banana pear with newlines separating
  ```
```powershell
$myblock = { Get-Service | Format-Table Name, Status }
#to run the scriptblock 
& myblock
```
```powershell
$a = 1
$b = { 1 + 1 }
$a += &$b
#or
$a += invoke-command $b
```
```powershell
Get-Service | sort-object -property status
#gets all services sorted by the property of "status" (running, stopped, etc)
```
```powershell
Get-Process | Sort-Object StartTime | Select-Object -Last 10 | Format-Table ProcessName, StartTime
#lists 10 longest running processes
#will throw an error, since "idle" does not have a start time. To filter it out:
Get-Process | where-object processname -ne "idle" | Sort-Object StartTime | Select-Object -Last 10 | Format-Table ProcessName, StartTime
```
```powershell
#measure the sum of elements in an array using ForEach-Object
#$array = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
$sum = 0
$array | ForEach-Object { $sum +=; $sum }
$sum
```
```powershell 
#using Get-Unique 
1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 | Get-Unique
#using Measure-Object 
Get-ChildItem | Measure-Object Length -Average -Maximum -Minimum -Sum

```powershell
#create test file and snapshot of directory
'What is the answer to lif, the universe, and everything?' > test.txt
$before = Get-ChildItem
#modify test file and new snapshot

$after = Get-ChildItem
#use comapare-object $before $after -Property Length, Name
```

## Activity
### The Pipeline Activity
  1. Display the start time of the earliest and latest running processes
    
  ```powershell
  Get-Process | Where-Object{$_.StartTime} | `
  Measure-Object -Property StartTime -Minimum -Maximum | `
  Select-Object -Property Minimum, Maximum
  ```
  2. Identify a cmdlet that returns the current date and time then using this cmdlet and Select-object, display only the current day of the week
```powershell
Get-Date | Select-Object DayofWeek
```
  3. Identify a cmdlet that displays a list of installed hotfixes.
```powershell
Get-Hotfix
```
  4. Extend the expression to sort the list by install date, and display only the install date and hotfix ID.
```powershell
Get-Hotfix | sort-object InstalledOn | Select-Object HotfixID, InstalledOn
```
  5. Extend the expression further, but this time sort by description, include description, hotfix ID, and install Date.
```powershell
Get-Hotfix | Sort-Object Description | Select-Object Description, HotFixID, InstalledOn
```

```
## Activity
### Custom Object Activity

  1. Create a custom object that contains information about the host system using the following 
      - Win32_ComputerSystem
      - Win32_BIOS
      - Win32_OperatingSystem
      - Win32_LogicalDisk

$text -match $pattern
```

```powershell
#display only the services wwith the status of 'running
Get-Service | Where-Object{$_.Status -eq 'running'}
Get-Service | Where-Object{$_.Status -like 'runn'}
Get-Service | Where-Object{$_.Status -match 'run'}

### Comparison and Condition Activity
  1. Find and extract the model number from the provided lines of text. 
      - If there isnâ€™t a model number then display to the user that a model number wasnâ€™t found
  2. Check both lines for model numbers and report individually the line and model number if found.
  3. Use the following variables for your script
      - $line1 = "Do you have model number: MT5437 for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
      - $line2 = "What model number for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
```powershell
$line1 = "Do you have model number: MT5437 for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
$line2 = "What model number for john.doe@sharklasers.com?"
$pattern = '([A-Z]){2}(\d{4})'
switch ($pattern) {
  { $line1 -match $_ } {
      $line1 -match $pattern | out-null
      $model = $matches[0]
      "yes the model number is $model" }
  { $line2 -match $_ } {
      $line2 -match $pattern | out-null
      $model = $matches[0]
      "yes the model number is $model" }
  { $line1 -notmatch $_ } {
      "There is no model number in line1" }
   { $line2 -notmatch $_ } {
      "There is no model number in line2" }
 }
#or
$line1,$line2 | foreach-object { if($_ -match "[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}") {$Matches.Values } else { 'Model not found' } }
